        description: "Iraq's central bank will ban five more local banks from engaging in U.S. dollar transactions, a move that comes after meetings with U.S. Treasury officials in efforts to combat money laundering, dollar smuggling and other violations, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday. The move comes after meetings in Dubai last week between officials from the Central Bank of Iraq - which last year already banned eight banks from U.S. dollar transactions - and U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, one of the sources said. A rare ally of both the United States and Iran with more than $100 billion in reserves held in the U.S., Iraq relies heavily on Washington's goodwill to ensure that its access to oil revenues and finances are not blocked. But OPEC's second-largest producer may find itself in the crosshairs after U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would restore his 'maximum pressure' policy towards Iran. Iran views its neighbour and ally Iraq as an economic 'lung' and wields considerable military, political and economic influence there through the powerful Shi'ite militias and political parties it backs. It also sources hard currency from Iraq through exports and avoids U.S. sanctions via its banking system.",

Beyoncé first performed songs from her album “Cowboy Carter” during the halftime show of a Houston Texans-Baltimore Ravens game on Christmas Day. The game was streamed on Netflix, and the performance became available as a stand-alone special on the streaming platform.',

        description: "Breakfast specialists Denny's will accelerate planned store closures in 2025 amid continued consumer shifts toward preferences for fast-food and take-out options. On an earnings call Wednesday, CFO Robert Verostek said the closures would incorporate a mix of poorly performing restaurants and ones with expiring leases. According to industry publication Restaurant Dive, the new closures represent about 30 more from a previously planned shuttering of 150 locations. Denny's remains publicly traded; today, its shares are worth less than $5, compared to the most recent high of about $24 seen in 2019. The brand ended last year with 1,334 U.S. stores, with most located in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.",

        category: "Technology",
        description: "Apple and Google have made TikTok available on their U.S. app stores again, they said Thursday evening. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance, disappeared from both stores in the United States on Jan. 18, hours before a ban on the social media app was set to go into effect. It had remained unavailable to download on both Apple's App Store and Google's Play store until Thursday. However, users who had previously downloaded it could continue to use it. Google and Apple did not comment Thursday evening beyond saying the app was available. The ban, which is rooted in national security concerns, was the result of a law President Joe Biden signed in April that mandated that ByteDance sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or be blocked in the United States on Jan. 19. After a number of appeals, the Supreme Court upheld the law on Jan. 17, paving the way for it to shut down in the country. Days before he left office, Biden's administration said it would leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, which was set to take office Jan. 20. TikTok restored service to the United States on Jan. 19 after having blocked it the night before, saying it had done so based on pledges from incoming President Donald Trump to save the app. Trump had indicated that he would sign an executive order 'to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security'",
